# ibm-containers-codemotion
Labs and tutorials used Codemotion.es 2015 for IBM Containers, a hosted Docker-based container service on IBM Bluemix.

## What is IBM Containers?

Use [IBM Containers](http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/solutions/open-architecture/) to run Docker containers in a hosted cloud environment on IBM Bluemix™. IBM Containers helps you build and deploy containers where you can package your applications and services. Each container is based on an image format, includes a set of standard operations, and is an execution environment in itself.

Containers are virtual software objects that include all the elements that an application needs to run. Each container includes just the app and its dependencies, running as an isolated process on the host operating system. Therefore, it has the benefits of resource isolation and allocation, but is more portable and efficient. Containers help you build high-quality apps, fast.

IBM Bluemix™ provides the IBM Containers infrastructure as a feature that is available in selected regions. Containers enable you to build your app in any language, with any programming tools. On Bluemix, you start developing with containers by using a trusted container image. With your organization’s private registry, you can automate your build pipeline and share artifacts with collaborators through public or private registries, while quickly integrating your container-based applications with over 150 Bluemix services. Containers simplify system administration by providing standardized environments for development and production teams. They help remove the complexity of managing different operating system platforms and underlying infrastructure. Containers help you deploy and run any app on any infrastructure, quickly and reliably.
